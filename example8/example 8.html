Specifically, there are three characters that should always be escaped to make sure they don't cause rendering issues, either right away or down the line. And these characters are the following. The character, the > character and the &. Instead of using the character, you should use the HTML entity which starts with & and then followed by lt;. So if you put in your HTML, what the browser will interpret this as a < character. And similarly, for the > character, it's . And for the & it is .
